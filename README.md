# DAA-Assignments

These assignments are group projects which focuses on how to get most efficient algorithms and with time and space complexity along with the room of discussion , conclusion and improvement.

##Assignment-1
###Partition an unsorted list of integers into adjacent sorted subsets. Let n be the size of the original unsorted list and N be the number of partitions generated from it. Plot a graph to show the probability values Prob(N=2,3,... etc.) for different values of n

##Assignment-2
###Write an efficient algorithm for the following purpose. For a given value of n (n>3), generate an (n x n) matrix whose cells are filled with randomly generated digits 0,.., 9. Now, scan the matrix with a (3 x 3) mask and find out those masks (mask positions) which contain a specific pattern (for example successive numbers are in a non-decreasing order). Note that, you can report a mask position by only mentioning the top-left position of the mask. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm

##Assignment-3
###Write an efficient algorithm to generate an (n x n) matrix filled with randomly generated English alphabet characters. Find out all diagonal locations containing valid English words. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm

##Assignment-4
###Given a Heap, write an efficient algorithm to locate the 1st largest,2nd largest,..., kth largest element in the Heap, for some given input value of k. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.
